<p> Love to walk? Yes, I do too! Bernal Hill is more known, and Bernall and Potrero sit next to the mission and are both beautiful places to go explore, even though they are considered more neighboorhoods.</p>

<p>Cool houses I could never afford, including traditional SF victorians, and the more modern condo type houses.</p>

<h2>Fantastic Scenery and Sunsets</h2>

<p>I love to explore and get lost around here, there is so much in SF hills that most don't get all the way up! Highly recommend climbing high hills (pun intended).</p>

<h2>The Whole City infront of You</h2>

<p>So much to explore and find out secrets. So much to explore and find out secrets. So much to explore and find out secrets. So much to explore and find out secrets. So much to explore and find out secrets. So much to explore and find out secrets. </p>
