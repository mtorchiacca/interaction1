<p class="center-align"> Love to walk? Yes, I do too! Bernal Hill is more known, and Bernall and Potrero sit next to the mission and are both beautiful places to go explore, even though they are considered more neighboorhoods. One of my favorites is "Mini Potrero", and the many stair cases around it.</p>


<h2>Really Nice (Expensive) Houses</h2>
<img src="assets/ph2.jpg" alt="Smiles 2" height="600" width="600" class="center"</img>
<p>Cool houses I could never afford, including traditional SF victorians, and the more modern condo type houses. It would be a dream to live way up on the hill, overlooking the bay.</p>

<h2>Fantastic Scenery and Sunsets</h2>

<p>I love to explore and get lost around here, there is so much in SF hills that most don't get all the way up! Highly recommend climbing high hills (pun intended). Having a bike is the most efficient way to move around quickly, and one with gears like my MTN bike will get you up any hill, but pushing is also ok too!</p>

<h2>The Whole City infront of You</h2>

<p>You will see many things which will impress you along the way, and could be inspiration for your design practice. </p>

<h2>Car Tire Boot and Bin</h2>
